Code repository for the browser extension to unlock the articles behind the medium.com membership paywall.

Try the production version of the extension here:
- For Chrome: Download the latest archive from the releases sections. Extract the archive. Go to extensions page (or type in the browser's URL `chrome://extensions`). Enable `Developer mode`. Click `Load unpacked`. Show the path where you extracted the archive.
- For Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/medium-unlimited-read-for-free.

**If someone knows how to build the firefox extension, please add a PR to add assets to the release section.**

## Development

Run the following to build the code:

```shell
npm run dev         #For local development
#or
npm run build       #For production release
```

This will generate the bundle and other required files in ./dist directory.

Load the generated Chrome extension in chrome by `Kebab menu(â‹®) -> More Tools -> Extensions` and then click on `LOAD UNPACKED` and select the dist folder.
Chrome extension is loaded and ready to use.
